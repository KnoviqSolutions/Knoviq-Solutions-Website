      <b>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT COMPLIANCE (CalOPPA)</b>
      <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>
      <p>Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA).
      According to the California Online Privacy act, you have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Know what personal data is being collected.
      <li>Know whether your personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
      <li>Access to your personal data.
      <li>Request to delete any personal information about you.
      <li>Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.
      </ul>
      <b>CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION</b>
      <p>We are in compliance with the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) regarding the protection of the personal data of minors. We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, platform and services are all directed to people who are at least 18 years old or older.</p>

      <b>EDITING AND DELETING INFORMATION</b>
      <p>If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect. You can change, modify, rectify and delete your Information at any time, please contact us through the contact information.</p>
